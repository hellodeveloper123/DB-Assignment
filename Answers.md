1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is such that each product belongs to one specific category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it. It's like organizing products into different groups or types based on their characteristics or purpose. For example, in an e-commerce platform, you might have categories like "Electronics," "Clothing," or "Home Appliances," and each product such as a smartphone or a shirt would belong to one of these categories.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can use a method called referential integrity. This means that for every product entry in the "Product" table, there must be a corresponding category entry in the "Product_Category" table. We typically achieve this by setting up a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table that references the primary key in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that a product cannot exist without a valid category associated with it. It's like having a rule in place that says, "Before you add a product, make sure it belongs to an existing category." This helps maintain data accuracy and consistency in the database.
